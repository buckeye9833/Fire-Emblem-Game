This is a fan-made recreation of the Fire Emblem Series, utilizing Python 2.7, Pygame, and GIMP created textures/images.
The goal of this code is to allow fellow programmers to have a base to work off of/ use as a reference and allow others to
  create their own versions, maps, levels, storylines similar to the base game.
Having played over 5 different releases in the Fire Emblem Series, some over 5 times through, I have always loved the challenge
  that the game presented and once I started working with arrays and with Pygame I realized that I had the ability to recreate a 
  childhood favorite game. My hope is that others can benefit from the wrk I've put into this so far and help me out with any bugs
  that might appear as well as improving the overall design/flow of the game.
  
Feel free to post an questions you might have about the program as well any suggestions.


More updates to follow.
